This repository contains a customer data management application built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Redux Saga, and Material-UI (MUI), with some components styled using Bootstrap 5. 

Please note that this application is configured to interact with a local server. 

It serves as a practical example of managing customer data, with features for adding, editing, and displaying customer information. 

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs, keeping in mind the local server dependency
